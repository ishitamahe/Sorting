# Sorting
## Aim
To use different methods of sorting to sort an array of numbers.
## Theory
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. The 3 methods of sorting used in this program are Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort. Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. Insertion sort algorithm to arrange numbers of an array in ascending order.
## Conclusion
In this practical, we learnt the concept of sorting. We learnt the difference betweeen bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort. We also learnt how the implement them to arrange the array of numbers in ascending order.
